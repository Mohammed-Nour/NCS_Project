# Implementation of a Security Operations Center (SOC) Using Wazuh Tool

This repository contains the implementation details, configurations, and documentation for building a functional Security Operations Center (SOC) using open-source tools. The project integrates **Wazuh (SIEM)**, **AbuseIPDB (Threat Intelligence Platform)**, and **IRIS (Ticketing System)** to provide a comprehensive framework for detecting, analyzing, and responding to security incidents.

---

## Features

- **Comprehensive SOC Setup**: Fully functional Security Operations Center utilizing open-source tools.
- **SIEM Integration**: Wazuh tool for security event management and log analysis.
- **Threat Intelligence**: AbuseIPDB integration for enriched threat data and automated incident handling.
- **Incident Management**: IRIS configuration for case management and response automation.
- **Active Response Mechanisms**: Automated responses to common security threats like brute force attacks and malware detection.

## Project Structure

### Goal

The objective of this project is to enhance the capabilities of detecting, analyzing, and responding to security incidents using a combination of open-source tools and automated workflows.

### Key Tasks and Contributions

- **Infrastructure Setup**: Environment setup and Wazuh configuration.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Integration with AbuseIPDB for enriching security data.
- **Incident Automation**: Automated workflows and responses for detected incidents.
- **Case Management**: IRIS setup for incident ticketing and tracking.
- **Testing & Documentation**: Simulated attacks and consolidated reporting.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Virtual machines or Docker setup.
- Linux-based operating system (Ubuntu 20.04/22.04).
- Access to AbuseIPDB API and IRIS configuration.

### Installation

1. **Wazuh Setup**:  
   Follow the [official installation guide](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/installation-guide/index.html).

2. **AbuseIPDB Integration**:  
   Refer to the [AbuseIPDB Integration](/report.md#working-instances-of-tools).


3. **IRIS Setup**:  
   Install and configure IRIS using Docker. See the [IRIS integration section](/report.md#working-instances-of-tools).

## Usage

### Detection and Alerting

- Configure Wazuh to monitor security events.
- Use AbuseIPDB for threat intelligence enrichment.
- Trigger alerts for incidents like brute force attacks or malware detection.

### Automated Response

- Enable Wazuhâ€™s active response mechanisms (e.g., IP blocking, account disabling).
- Automatically log incidents into IRIS for tracking and escalation.

---

## Challenges and Insights

- Resolved issues with API compatibility during tool integration.
- Overcame networking and configuration challenges in a multi-tool environment.
- Gained hands-on experience with incident response automation and SOC tools.

---

## Future Improvements

- Expand the SOC with additional tools like MISP for advanced threat intelligence.
- Optimize active response mechanisms for faster incident handling.
- Enhance documentation and scripts for seamless integration.
